## Introduction

Environment Monitoring and Management System by Greenhouse A/S, is an integrated setup combining embedded devices, a centralized server, and seamless networking. It provides continuous monitoring of conditions like temperature and humidity, ensuring ideal plant growth. Sensor data can be analyzed via a website or by the system itself, it will push alarms if any anomalies occurs. This cohesive system ensures agricultural efficiency and proactive management of greenhouse environments.

## Server Side


<a name="about-the-server"></a>

#### About the Server

The server is running Raspberry Pi OS Lite which is a lightweight version of the Raspberry Pi operating system, based on Debian Linux.

 It is optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware and is a command-line only interface, meaning no graphical desktop.


<a name="main-api-and-endpoints"></a>

### Main API and endpoints

The API facilitates greenhouse environment monitoring and management, handling sensor data for temperature and humidity, and allows for configuration changes and retrieval of current settings. It supports the creation of new facility, building, and sensor records, and offers a dashboard view for real-time data and alerts

## Client Side

<a name="linux-based-client"></a>

### Linux Based Client

<a name="about-the-client"></a>

#### About the Client

The client is a raspberry 3 using grovepi sensors

<a name="how-to-use-it-3"></a>

#### How to Use It

##### Step 1: Connecting via SSH
1. Open your SSH client of choice on your computer.
2. Connect to the client device using its IP address or hostname.

##### Step 2: Cloning the Repository
1. Once connected via SSH, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Clone the `embedded_device` repository using the following command: `git clone git@github.com:mart337i/embeded_device.git`

##### Step 3: Installing Python and Dependencies
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on the client device. If not, install it using the device's package manager.
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd embeded_device`

3. Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` with the following command: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`


##### Step 4: Setting Up Systemd Service
1. Set up the Systemd unit file by creating a new file with the `.service` extension in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory.
2. Copy the Systemd configuration from the provided [Systemd](#Systemd_config) section into this new file.
3. Run the systemd commands listed below in that order

**systemd commands** 
```bash

systemctl enable <name of service>.service
systemctl start <name of service>.service
systemctl status <name of service>.service
systemctl restart <name of service>.service

```

<a name="tools-and-frameworks-3"></a>

#### Tools and Frameworks

- SystemD

  - systemd is system and service manager for most Unix like operating systems
    As the system boots up, the first process created
    with process id : `PID = 1` thats systemd. Sytemd then starts/creates the rest of the userspace. 

    For this project it is used to start the client service, to collect information from the sensors.
    The main benefit is the automatic start on boot and the auto restart on failiure, alongside its loging capabilities using `journalctl -f -u <process name>` in this case `-f` is for following the log and `-u` is a systemd unit / service 
    <br/><br/>

  <a name="Systemd_config"></a>
  - SystemD config

    ```bash
    [Unit]
    Description=embeded service
    After=multi-user.target

    [Service]
    StartLimitBurst=0
    Type=simple
    Restart=on-failure
    StartLimitIntervalSec=10
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/code/embeded_device/main.py

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

- Python libs
  - grovepi
    - open-source platform for connecting Grove Sensors to the Rasberry Pi.
  - datetime
    - Used for constructing datetime objects.
  - requests
    - allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.
  - python-dotenv
    - Python-dotenv reads key-value pairs from a .env file
  - json
    - built-in package which can be used to work with JSON data.
  - logging
    - provides a flexible framework for writing log messages
  - time
    - provides functions for handling time-related tasks (Only used the sleep method)

### Embedded Device

<a name="about-the-device"></a>

#### About the Device

I am using the M5GO, powered by the ESP32 chip, which is an embedded device designed for IoT applications, capable of collecting data from APIs. It features a dual-core processor, Wi-Fi connectivity, and 16M flash memory.

<a name="how-to-use-it-4"></a>

#### How to Use It

This guide assumes that you have PlatformIO installed and set up on your device. If you do not have PlatformIO installed, please visit the [PlatformIO installation guide](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html) before proceeding.

##### Step 1: Cloning the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command line interface.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the `embedded_device` repository: `git clone git@github.com:mart337i/embedded_device.git`

##### Step 2: Opening the Project in PlatformIO
1. Launch PlatformIO from your system's application menu or command line.
2. In PlatformIO, go to 'File' > 'Open Project'.
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open it.

##### Step 3: Uploading the Code to the Device
1. Connect your device to your computer via USB.
  1.1 If you like me run into permission error on the serial port run 
    `sudo chown <yourname> /dev/<usb port name like : ttyUSB0>`
2. Select the correct serial port and board configuration in PlatformIO.
3. Press the 'Upload' button, represented by a right arrow (->), located in the PlatformIO toolbar (Image below).

After completing these steps, the code should be uploaded to your device, and it should be running the program.
![PlatformIO upload](../img/platformIO_upload.png "platform io upload")

The M5GO will automaticly restart and run the code you pushed to it.

```

### Firewall settings
The ports specified below are required open:

- **OpenSSH**: This rule allows remote logins via the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, which by default uses port 22. This is essential for securely managing the server remotely.
- **22**: This explicitly allows traffic on port 22, which is the default port for SSH connections.
- **80**: This opens up port 80, which is the default port used for HTTP traffic.
- **443**: This port is for HTTPS traffic, which is HTTP over TLS/SSL, providing secure web browsing (i chould close this becouse i dont use https, but i am keeping it open for further development).

The rules are duplicated for IPv6 traffic (indicated by `(v6)`), ensuring the server accepts connections via both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols on these ports.


```bash
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----

80                         ALLOW       Anywhere
443                        ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
22 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

443 (v6)                   ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

### Code of conduct

#### File structure

```bash

/home/pi/code
|   dashboard
|   fastapi (Main api)
|   Nginx_log (Error and access log for both)
|
/etc/nginx
|   nginx.conf (Base config)
|   sites-enabled
|       fastapi-app.conf (Custom config)
|
/etc/supervisor/conf.d
    dashboard.conf (Dashboard config)
    fastapi-app.conf (Fastapi config)

```

#### Git guidelines

Not all of the following has been used but is still consideres part of the Code conduct.

```Text
    [FIX] for bug fixes: mostly used in stable version but also valid if you are fixing a recent bug in development version;

    [REF] for refactoring: when a feature is heavily rewritten;

    [ADD] for adding new modules;

    [REM] for removing resources: removing dead code, removing views, removing modules, â€¦;

    [REV] for reverting commits: if a commit causes issues or is not wanted reverting it is done using this tag;

    [MOV] for moving files: use git move and do not change content of moved file otherwise Git may loose track and history of the file; also used when moving code from one file to another;

    [IMP] for improvements: most of the changes done in development version are incremental improvements not related to another tag;

    [MERGE] for merge commits: used in forward port of bug fixes but also as main commit for feature involving several separated commits;

    [I18N] for changes in translation files;

```

### Still missing overall

- Fail2ban
  - This service is a well known security mesure that would help combat SSH Brute-force attacks. It work be scanning files like `/var/log/auth.log` and bans IP addresses conducting too many failed login attempts
- JSON Web Token (JWT) or another token based api security
  - Using JWT token would help restrict accses to the api endpoint, but would also require client to be able to authenticate itself via a endpoint located on the main api. 
- SSL Cert
  - Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate would enable tcp encryption and therefore make man-in-middle attacks harder to accomplice. 
- Auth0 (Maybe over engineering)
  - Auth0 is an identity platform to add authentication and authorization. Auth0 would enable users to authenticate themself at diffrent levels of the application. depending on futere development this chould be setup with Nginx to lock down the network the application oprates at. It also provides crossplatform authentication.
- Hide nginx version i network tab
  - This is a commen security messure and is done to make it harder to now what exploits the nginx server is vulnerable.
  A good example of how easy it is find, here is a [link](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-10048/Nginx.html) with a list of known vulnerabilities 
- Block accses to doc files 
  - This is done to not expose api endpoints for an attacker to find and exploit

## Conclusion

This project has personally given me knowlegde about how to set up production ready api's and server set-ups. While there is still a lot to be done to make it acceptiable to be used in enterprise level production, i feel many steps ahead of then i first started the project. 

I have gained knowlegde in the usage of unix based systems and look forward to learn more about the capability of linux. I have also gained knowlegede about how Iot devices can be used to help automate and control devices around us, making our work ligher and, or easier.

## Glossary

- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules that allows programs to interact with each other, facilitating data exchange and integration.
- **Client**: The requesting program in a client/server relationship; typically, a user interface that allows interaction with the server.
- **Dashboard**: A user interface that organizes and presents information in an easy to read and change values.
- **ER (Entity-Relationship) Diagram**: A diagram that shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database.
- **Gunicorn**: A Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX systems, designed to serve fast web applications.
- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: The interconnection of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.
- **Linux**: An open-source operating system that is the foundation of many servers and embedded systems.
- **MariaDB**: A community-developed fork of the MySQL relational database management system, intended to remain free under the GNU GPL.
- **Monorepo**: A software development strategy where code for many projects is stored in the same repository.
- **Manyrepo**: A software development strategy where code for many projects is stored in many diffrent repositories to keep the project organized.
- **NGINX**: A web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache.
- **Raspberry Pi OS Lite**: A lightweight version of the Raspberry Pi operating system without a graphical user interface.
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: A cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other secure network services between two networked computers.
- **Supervisor**: A client/server system that allows users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.
- **SystemD**: A system and service manager for Linux operating systems that uses units to manage system resources.
- **Uvicorn**: A lightning-fast ASGI server for Python, used as the foundation for frameworks like FastAPI.
